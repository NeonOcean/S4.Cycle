## Dot App
- Allow the app to send the player notifications when a sim is fertile. (By patron request!) (Available in patron preview version!)

## Mod Support
(Let me know about a mod you want Cycle to support. If I know many people want Cycle the support a certain mod then it increases the likelihood I will add such support.)

- Basemental Drugs, doing drugs should negatively impact fetus health, it should even cause miscarriages.

## New Items
- Birth Control Pills  (Available in patron preview version!)
	- Would greatly reduce the chance that a sim ovulates.
	- Can cause periods to be lighter or even stop.
	- Purchasable only after getting a prescription from a doctor, settings should allow this requirement to be disabled.

- Plan B
	- Delays ovulation to try to prevent pregnancy.

- Pregnancy Test (Available in patron preview version!)
	- Replacement for the simplistic interaction on toilets (Which doesn't currently work well with Cycle).
	- Pregnancy tests would no longer increase the pregnancy progress like it does in the base game.
	- Would allow you to test without required your sim to have tried for a baby recently.

## Pregnancy Buffs
- The game has pregnancy buffs always make the sim happy. This doesn't work when accidental pregnancy becomes a possibility. Pregnancy buffs should at least apply a neutral mood effect and not exclaim how happy a sim is about it.
- What a sim feels about their pregnancy could be settable by the player. (By patron request!)

## Manual control
- Sims could have different levels of manual control, specified by the player.
- The mod could refer to a certain sim in the second-person (uses "you" to refer to the sim instead "him/her/they").
- Sims chosen to be manually controlled by the player wouldn't do some things automatically, like remember to take their birth control pills.
- This feature would be good for players who like to focus on one or two sims in a household.

## Abortion
- Sims would be able to get an abortion at a hospital.

## Miscarriage
- Pregnancy could end in an miscarriage randomly a certain percentage of times. (It should be possible to disable this)
- Certain actions could increase the likelihood of miscarriage.

## Area Laws
- Things like birth control and abortions could be illegal or hard to get depending on what neighborhood you live in.
- Abortions could be obtainable through other, potentially dangerous means.
- Area laws should be changeable through settings, the laws would be realistic but not everyone wants to deal with it.

## Unknown Parents
- Babies' family trees shouldn't list a father if there are more than one potential father.
- Babies of cheating sims should list the mother's official partner as the father, even if they are not.
- DNA testing could allow for the discovery of a sim's the true parents.
