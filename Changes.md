## v1.1.2 (July 6, 2020)

### WickedWhims Support
- Cycle now has basic support for the mod "WickedWhims". I don't understand why some of you like this mod. I've added support because many people seem to want it and some are just ignoring my warnings about the two mods being incompatible.
- "Woohoo" interactions added by WickedWhims now add sperm to sims.
- WickedWhims's period system is now disabled and replaced by Cycle.
- Cycle's condoms boxes must be unpacked before they can be used with WickedWhims's interactions.
