## v1.2.0-beta.1 (August 9, 2020)

## Emergency Contraceptive Pill
- A one use item that temporarily delays the release of a sim's egg cell in order to buy time for sperm in their system to die off.
- Sims should take this pill as soon as possible after an accident in the bed room, in order to prevent accidental pregnancy.

______________________________

## v1.2.0-alpha.5 (July 17, 2020)

## Birth Control Pills
- Can now be purchased in the purchase contraceptives menu.
- The effectiveness of the medication slowly increases the longer a sim is on the pill. It is advised to use additional protection during a sim's first cycle after starting the medication.
- The built up effectiveness can be quickly lost if you forget to have a sim take their medication for too long.
- Use of birth control pills also gradually reduces the severity of a sim's menstruation. This can get to the point where it becomes extremely light or appears to stop entirely.

## PMS
- A certain percentage of sims will be randomly selected to have to endure premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
- PMS will start a short time before menstruation begins and carries negative and positive moodlets.
- Those going through PMS can experience bloating, fatigue, mood swings, and cramping.
- PMS can be manually enabled for specific sims through a setting in the new sims settings menu.

## WickedWhims Support
- WickedWhim's birth control pills object are now recognized by Cycle and function as they should.

## v1.2.0-alpha.1 (June 29, 2020)

### Pregnancy Test
- Added new pregnancy test object. Pregnancy tests now (optionally) require a pregnancy test to be purchased before hand.
- Pregnancy tests now longer give happy or sad buffs, they only show simple notifications. This works better for this mod since it is now possible to become pregnant accidentally. Sims shouldn't be necessarily be sad they didn't get pregnant from a one night stand, nor should they be necessarily happy if they did.
- Taking a pregnancy test will no longer jump a sim's pregnancy progress forward after taking a pregnancy test, like it does in the base game.
- Pregnancy tests can now be taken at any time, not just by sims who recently tried for a baby. They can also be taken by people who can't normally get pregnant by try for baby interactions.
- Tests can now return false results, especially when taken very early into a pregnancy.

### Quality of life improvements
- Notifications now appear when a sim runs out of condoms.
- Notifications also appear when two woohooing sims have a noticeable failure of their birth control methods. 

### Other Changes
- Box of condoms price, 100 > 75

- WickedWhims's period system is now disabled and replaced by Cycle.
- Cycle's condoms boxes must be unpacked before they can be used with WickedWhims's interactions.
